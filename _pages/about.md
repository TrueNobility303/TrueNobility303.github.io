Welcome! I am currently an undergraduate in [School of Data Science](http://www.sds.fudan.edu.cn) at Fudan University. 
My research interests are mainly on Artificial Intelligence, Statistics and Algorithm.

During my undergraduate career, I have the fortune to be advised by Professor [Luo Luo](https://luoluo-sds.github.io/), doing the research on stochastic optimization, minimax optimization and distributed optimization.
